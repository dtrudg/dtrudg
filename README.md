Hello, I'm David Trudgian. I'm an experienced software engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, living in the UK. My studies and career have spanned machine learning, bioinformatics, and high performance computing (HPC).

I currently work for [Sylabs](https://sylabs.io) where I am maintainer of the SingularityCE open source container runtime, and oversee SingularityPRO - a commercial long-term supported version.

I use this GitHub account for work related code and collaborations only. My personal stuff is elsewhere, and under different usernames. Note that I do not check GitHub notifications oustide of working hours / workdays. It might take me a little while for me to get back to you if I'm on holiday.
